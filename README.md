# Daily manager

This is a simple todolist I've made using React/Typescript. It acts as a simple note app with some other functionnalities such as sign in and saving data on firebase cloud. You can live preview it [here](https://daily-manager.netlify.app/), you just need to log in with an email and all your data will be saved on the cloud using firestore.

### Installation

To run the project locally you have to create an app in [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) first and retrieve your own credentials, put these in an **.env.local** file. There is already an environment variable template named **.env.local.txt** in the pushed commits so you just have to remove the **.txt** extension and replace the content with yours.

Then you'll need to install the project with:

``
npm install
``

Once installed and the environment variables ready, you can run this command to start the project locally:

``
npm start
``

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it live in the browser.

### Side note

Major updates will come soon so stay tuned. Please star the repo and fork it as you wish, feel free to contribute to this repo and propose new functionnalities for the app !
